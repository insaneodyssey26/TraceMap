## FAQ

**Why is Privacy Mode important?**  
Many companies don't allow sending proprietary code to external APIs. Privacy Mode ensures all analysis runs locally – no data leaves your machine.

**What exactly uses AI vs local analysis?**  
- **Local (works in Privacy Mode):** Code search (keyword-based), dead code detection, quality metrics, type safety checks, complexity analysis, refactoring suggestions
- **Uses AI (optional upgrade):** Natural language code search with semantic understanding

**How good is local search compared to AI?**  
Local search is excellent for specific queries like "authentication functions", "API calls", "form handlers". AI search is better for complex, natural language queries like "Where do we validate user input before saving to database?"

**Can I use both search modes?**  
Yes! Toggle Privacy Mode on/off anytime. Local search is always available, AI search requires an API key.

**How do I enable Privacy Mode?**  
Click the status bar badge (🌐 **Public** / 🔒 **Private**) for instant toggle. Or use Command Palette → "Toggle Privacy Mode", or go to Settings.

**Can I see Privacy Mode status?**  
Yes! Three places:
1. Status bar shows 🔒 **Private** badge (highlighted) when active
2. Search button shows "Local Search" in Privacy Mode
3. Code Quality button shows "(Private)" indicator

**What is dead code?**  
Code that is never used or run, like old functions or imports you forgot to delete.

**Why should I care about code quality?**  
Good code is easier to read, fix, and build on. It helps you and your team avoid bugs and confusion.

**What is a code snapshot?**  
A backup of your file before changes, so you can restore it if needed.

**Do I need to know AI or machine learning?**  
No! Most features work without any AI. The AI search is optional.

**Will it change my code automatically?**  
No, it only suggests changes. You decide what to apply. Snapshots are saved before any edits.

**What are magic numbers?**  
Numbers in code with no explanation (like 42 or 0.8). Use named constants instead so your code is clear.

**How do I check code quality?**  
Click the “Code Quality” button in the status bar or run the command from the Command Palette.

**Which languages are supported?**  
Works best with JavaScript and TypeScript, but many features help with other languages too.

**Where do I put my Gemini API key?**  
In VS Code settings, search for “What-The-Code”.

**Can I undo changes?**  
Yes! Snapshots are saved before changes, so you can restore your code.
