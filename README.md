## FAQ

**Why is Privacy Mode important?**  
Many companies don't allow sending proprietary code to external APIs. Privacy Mode ensures all analysis runs locally – no data leaves your machine.

**What exactly uses AI vs local analysis?**  
- **Local (works in Privacy Mode):** Dead code detection, quality metrics, type safety checks, complexity analysis, refactoring suggestions
- **Uses AI (disabled in Privacy Mode):** Natural language code search ("Ask Your Code")

**How do I enable Privacy Mode?**  
Open settings (Ctrl+,), search "What-The-Code", toggle "Privacy Mode". Or use Command Palette → "Toggle Privacy Mode"

**Can I see Privacy Mode status?**  
Yes! The status bar shows a shield icon (🔒) when Privacy Mode is active.

**What is dead code?**  
Code that is never used or run, like old functions or imports you forgot to delete.

**Why should I care about code quality?**  
Good code is easier to read, fix, and build on. It helps you and your team avoid bugs and confusion.

**What is a code snapshot?**  
A backup of your file before changes, so you can restore it if needed.

**Do I need to know AI or machine learning?**  
No! Most features work without any AI. The AI search is optional.

**Will it change my code automatically?**  
No, it only suggests changes. You decide what to apply. Snapshots are saved before any edits.

**What are magic numbers?**  
Numbers in code with no explanation (like 42 or 0.8). Use named constants instead so your code is clear.

**How do I check code quality?**  
Click the “Code Quality” button in the status bar or run the command from the Command Palette.

**Which languages are supported?**  
Works best with JavaScript and TypeScript, but many features help with other languages too.

**Where do I put my Gemini API key?**  
In VS Code settings, search for “What-The-Code”.

**Can I undo changes?**  
Yes! Snapshots are saved before changes, so you can restore your code.
